        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            In DALL路Edle, you are given a post from the subreddit
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weirddalle/">/r/weirddalle</a>,
            and your goal is to guess the input prompt.
        </p>
        <p>
            When your guess has a word that's in the input prompt, it will be
            revealed above. Once you have all of the words in the correct order,
            you win!
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike Wordle, games aren't tied to a specific day. Each time you
            refresh the page, you'll have a new prompt to solve. As of my
            writing this right now, there are a few hundred games loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you've got suggestions for how I can improve the game, please let
            me know on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/_Meorge">@_Meorge</a>!
        </p>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            I used Python scripts to generate the collection of games by
            scraping submissions to /r/weirddalle.
            The images themselves were cropped automatically, and the
            solutions are the names of the Reddit posts. As a result, the game
            has the following limitations:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Depending on how the user originally posted their image,
                you might be able to see the input prompt at the top.
                Alternatively, you might not be able to see as much of the
                output data. There also appear to be a few broken Imgur images
                in there.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game uses the title of the Reddit post as the input
                prompt you're searching for. This is true for many posts
                on the subreddit, but not all. Thus, it's possible the
                "correct" answer the game is expecting will differ from
                what the actual input prompt was.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Because this was meant to be a quick little fun project, I didn't
        want to spend too much time curating the game set. If by
        some miracle this gets popular, I'll probably work more on
        curation. Refresh the page in the meantime to get a new game.
        </p>
        <h2>Credit Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            Since it's arguable to what extent
            <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini">DALL路E mini</a>
            outputs are "owned" by the users who gave it the prompt, I felt like
            using subreddit posts with credit/attribution is sufficient. If you
            think I should do something differently here, please let me know on
            Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/_Meorge">@_Meorge</a>.
