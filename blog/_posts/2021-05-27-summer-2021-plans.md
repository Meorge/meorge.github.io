It's sure been one heck of a year for me so far! The Twitter bots I launched have done very well, and this summer I started an internship that's been a lot of fun. In this post I'd like to talk about what's happened, and what my plans are going forward.

## Twitter bots
In January (okay, *technically* it was in December), I launched the Twitter bot [@gpt2upaguy](https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy), which very quickly became my most widespread project to date.
In February, I launched [@HD2DGenerator](https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator), which also grew quite quickly.
And a few weeks ago, I kicked off my third bot, [@everymacOS](https://twitter.com/everymacOS), which aims to help Apple by posting a title card for a version of their desktop operating system named after every place in California. In order to make managing these bots easier, I created my own local Twitter bot system, called Tweetinator, learning a ton about Flask, MongoDB databases, and Raspberry Pis along the way.

The popularity of my bots has been really uplifting. As I'm writing this blog post, [@gpt2upaguy](https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy) has over 8,700 followers, and [@HD2DGenerator](https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator) has almost 4,000 followers. Getting to see people enjoying the weird stuff the bots post is extremely rewarding (even if said stuff is not actually made by me, haha). 

### Farewell, [@gpt2upaguy](https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy) (but not for a few months still!)
The [@gpt2upaguy](https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy) account was my first-ever dip into the world of machine learning, and it produced some really bizarre and amusing results. Here are a few of my favorite safe-for-work ones:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">guy who loves cats because they&#39;re cute and they&#39;re smart and they&#39;re big and</p>&mdash; gpt2 up a guy (@gpt2upaguy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy/status/1391271833475837956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">guy who just realized he&#39;s not a girl</p>&mdash; gpt2 up a guy (@gpt2upaguy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy/status/1394880522153697280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">guy who, you guessed it, is gay</p>&mdash; gpt2 up a guy (@gpt2upaguy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy/status/1367342688610119684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">dog who has incredible hearing but only hears horrible things</p>&mdash; gpt2 up a guy (@gpt2upaguy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy/status/1372601722250485763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">stop whatever you&#39;re doing and set us all on fire</p>&mdash; gpt2 up a guy (@gpt2upaguy) <a href="https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy/status/1381381779341238272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 11, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It's been quite the ride, but **for now, I think I'm done generating new posts for the [@gpt2upaguy](https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy) account.** The last few times I've tried to create new GPT-2 models for the account, the results have turned out poorly. Either:

- the model is undertrained, and the results aren't interesting,
- or the model is overtrained, and it just spits out verbatim posts from the training data.

I haven't been able to create a new model that has the same "magic" as the models from the early days of the bot. The gradual end of the account actually started, back in late May - I don't think I ever saw anyone take note of it, but posts moved from being every 30 minutes to every hour.

I want to stress, though, that **the bot isn't going away any time soon!** The last time I generated a new collection of "guys" for the bot, I generated a *lot* of them. There are over 2,000 Tweets queued up on the account as of right now, which places **the last Tweet somewhere in late August 2021**. So there's still plenty of content yet to come from the bot! And keep in mind that this decision isn't necessarily final; if I'm able to figure out how to train models more effectively, and/or get a nice new set of training data, I may decide to continue the bot. From where I am right now, though, I feel like this is likely to be the end for it. 

I may also post my trained models online, so that others can use them to generate their own guys. Please let me know if this is something that'd interest you!

### [@HD2DGenerator](https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator)'s future
My second bot, [@HD2DGenerator](https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator), aims to replicate the titles in Square Enix's HD-2D series of games, which currently consists of *Octopath Traveler* and *Project Triangle Strategy*), by taking two random nouns from an English dictionary and putting them together. The results have also been interesting to say the least:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Project Glockenspiel Calculator <a href="https://t.co/mfyDxjUfjq">pic.twitter.com/mfyDxjUfjq</a></p>&mdash; HD-2D Title Generator (@HD2DGenerator) <a href="https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator/status/1367856958917681155?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Project Metaphor Sexuality <a href="https://t.co/oqI4PUFsPQ">pic.twitter.com/oqI4PUFsPQ</a></p>&mdash; HD-2D Title Generator (@HD2DGenerator) <a href="https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator/status/1369746037678645252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Project Punch Racist <a href="https://t.co/6QknZDx3AO">pic.twitter.com/6QknZDx3AO</a></p>&mdash; HD-2D Title Generator (@HD2DGenerator) <a href="https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator/status/1379248794500427776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
Around the same time that I mass-generated posts for [@gpt2upaguy](https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy), I did the same for the [@HD2DGenerator](https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator) account, and right now it's got enough posts on it to make it to late July 2021. The simplicity of making posts for this account makes it much easier to generate a bunch at once without worrying about filtering them out, but it also means there's a lot more "nonsense" posts.

On a few occasions, I've taken requests for manual posts to the account, as well as made my own when I had an idea I really liked. Given that the "bot-ness" isn't nearly as an integral part of its identity as it is for [@gpt2upaguy](https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy), **I'm going to start taking post requests via DMs on the [@HD2DGenerator](https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator) account!** The randomly-generated posts will continue, but will be interspersed with submissions, depending on how many I receive. This'll be my first time taking requests for an account, and I've got a lot of other stuff on my plate as well right now, so it may take a bit of time to get up to speed. I'll do the best I can!

### Future bots
I've got a few ideas for Twitter bots that I may put into motion in the coming months, if/when I have time to. Several months ago, I started experimenting with GPT-2 models trained on the Twitter account [@KidsWriteJokes](https://twitter.com/KidsWriteJokes), and got some pretty good results:

{:.blockquote}
> what do you call an elephant with two goatees?
> 
> french cows

{:.blockquote}
> what did one pigeon say to the other pigeon?
> 
> I hope you're ready for all the milk you're gonna drink

{:.blockquote}
> what did the cat say when it bumped into the wall
> 
> WAIT A SECOND

I don't feel like I have enough posts generated yet to give myself a good buffer, so I'm going to wait on kicking that account off officially until I can dedicate a bit more time to it. When I have more news to share regarding this project, or any other projects, I'll be sure to post about them!


## *Sneaksters*
It's hard to believe it's been nearly three years since I started working on *[Sneaksters](/sneaksters.html)*. Without a doubt, the game is my longest-running project, and probably the one I'm most proud of.

</div>

Versions v0.4.6 and v0.4.7 of the pre-alpha released a few days ago with some nifty bug fixes improving support for the Xbox Wireless Controller and PlayStation DualShock 4 controller.

There are some ideas for new features and game mechanics I'd like to implement one day, but first I'd like to make sure that what's already there is (reasonably) bug-free, so I'm not building on top of a crumbling foundation. Between that, and not having a lot of time to work on projects due to my full-time internship, **I'm going to be taking a little bit of a hiatus from the game for now.** I'll still be active on the SneakHub Discord server and will try to respond to questions and feedback, but I won't be attempting to add any big new features until I'm more confident the game is ready for them.

## Other projects
As I stated previously, with my internship this summer, I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to personal projects. **I'm hoping to dedicate more time to my creative writing projects, including a heavily *Ace Attorney*- and *Encyclopedia Brown*-inspired visual novel script and a sci-fi/fantasy novel that I've been slowly building in my head for many years**. There are also a few mobile and web app ideas I've been thinking about that I may take a stab at realizing later this summer, depending on how things go. If I have anything cool to show off, I'll be sure to do so, both here on my blog and on my Twitter account.

## Conclusion
This summer looks like it's going to be quite busy for me, and definitely different than I was originally expecting - but still hopefully a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to learning a lot at my internship, and using it to make cool stuff in the future. Thanks for the support, and I hope to be able to share more things with you soon!
