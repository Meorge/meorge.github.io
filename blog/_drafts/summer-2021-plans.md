title: "The future of @gpt2upaguy, and my plans for summer 2021"
---

It's sure been one heck of a year for me! The Twitter bots I launched have done very well, and this summer I started an internship that's been a lot of fun. In this post I'd like to talk about what's happened, and what my plans are going forward.


## Twitter bots
In January (okay, *technically* it was in December), I launched the Twitter bot [@gpt2upaguy](https://twitter.com/gpt2upaguy), which very quickly became my most widespread project to date.
In February, I launched [@HD2DGenerator](https://twitter.com/HD2DGenerator), which also grew quite quickly.
And a few weeks ago, I kicked off my third bot, [@everymacOS](https://twitter.com/everymacOS), which aims to help Apple by posting a title card for a version of their desktop operating system named after every place in California. In order to make managing these bots easier, I created my own local Twitter bot system, called Tweetinator, learning a ton about Flask, MongoDB databases, and Raspberry Pis along the way.

The popularity of my bots has been really uplifting. As I'm writing this blog post, @gpt2upaguy has over 8,700 followers, and @HD2DGenerator has almost 4,000 followers. Getting to see people enjoying the weird stuff the bots post is extremely rewarding (even if said stuff is explicitly *not* made by me, haha). 

### Farewell, @gpt2upaguy (but not for a few months)
**For now, I think I'm done generating new posts for the @gpt2upaguy account.** The last few times I've tried to create new GPT-2 models for the account, the results have turned out poorly. Either:

- the model is undertrained, and the results aren't interesting,
- or the model is overtrained, and it just spits out verbatim posts from the training data.

I haven't been able to create a new model that has the same "magic" as the models from the early days of the bot. The gradual end of the account actually started, back in late May - I don't think I ever saw anyone take note of it, but posts moved from being every 30 minutes to every hour.

I want to stress, though, that **the bot isn't going away any time soon!** The last time I generated a new collection of "guys" for the bot, I generated a *lot* of them. There are over 2,000 Tweets queued up on the account as of right now, which places **the last Tweet somewhere in late August 2020**. So there's still plenty of content yet to come from the bot! And keep in mind that this decision isn't necessarily final; if I'm able to figure out how to train models more effectively, and/or get a nice new set of training data, I may decide to continue the bot. From where I am right now, though, I feel like this is likely to be the end for it. 

I may also post my trained models online, so that others can use them to generate their own guys. Please let me know if this is something that'd interest you!


### Future bots
I've got a few ideas for Twitter bots that I may put into motion in the coming months, if/when I have time to. Several months ago, I started experimenting with GPT-2 models trained on the Twitter account [@KidsWriteJokes](https://twitter.com/KidsWriteJokes), and got some pretty good results:

{:.blockquote}
> what do you call an elephant with two goatees?
> 
> french cows

{:.blockquote}
> what did one pigeon say to the other pigeon?
> 
> I hope you're ready for all the milk you're gonna drink

{:.blockquote}
> what did the cat say when it bumped into the wall
> 
> WAIT A SECOND

I don't feel like I have enough posts generated yet to give myself a good buffer, so I'm going to wait on kicking that account off officially until I can dedicate a bit more time to it. When I have more news to share regarding this project, or any other projects, I'll be sure to post about them!


## *Sneaksters*
It's hard to believe it's been nearly three years since I started working on *[Sneaksters](/sneaksters.html)*. Without a doubt, the game is my longest-running project, and probably the one I'm most proud of.

Versions v0.4.6 and v0.4.7 of the pre-alpha released a few days ago with some nifty bug fixes improving support for the Xbox Wireless Controller and PlayStation DualShock 4 controller.

There are some ideas for new features and game mechanics I'd like to implement one day, but first I'd like to make sure that what's already there is (reasonably) bug-free, so I'm not building on top of a crumbling foundation. Between that, and not having a lot of time to work on projects due to my full-time internship, **I'm going to be taking a little bit of a hiatus from the game for now.** I'll still be active on the SneakHub Discord server and will try to respond to questions and feedback, but I won't be attempting to add any big new features until I'm more confident the game is ready for them.

## Other projects
As I stated previously, with my internship this summer, I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to personal projects. **I'm hoping to dedicate more time to my creative writing projects, including a heavily *Ace Attorney*- and *Encyclopedia Brown*-inspired visual novel script and a sci-fi/fantasy novel that I've been slowly building in my head for many years**. There are also a few mobile and web app ideas I've been thinking about that I may take a stab at realizing later this summer, depending on how things go. If I have anything cool to show off, I'll be sure to do so, both here on my blog and on my Twitter account.

## Conclusion
This summer looks like it's going to be quite busy for me, and definitely different than I was originally expecting - but still hopefully a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to learning a lot at my internship, and using it to make cool stuff in the future. Thanks for the support, and I hope to be able to share more things with you soon!
