    <h2>Delphi DIY</h2>
    <p>
        So today (19 October 2021) I saw that the <a href="https://allenai.org">Allen Institute for AI</a>
        put up a webpage for an AI they've made called <a href="https://delphi.allenai.org/">Delphi</a>,
        which attempts to give moral judgements on whatever input you supply it. As everyone knows,
        there's nothing that can go wrong with artificial intelligence, especially when it comes to making
        moral judgements.
    </p>
    <p>
        One issue I have with Delphi is that it can give judgements that I do not agree with. To remedy
        this problem, I have created my own version of Delphi which will always support my positions.
        To keep this project private would be immoral (I asked it), so I decided to share it with you all!
    </p>

        Simply enter the Delphi input and output text below. You can then take a screenshot of the resulting
        card and post it on Twitter or whatever.

    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="text" class="form-control mb-3" id="inputText" placeholder="Input" value="Input goes here">
        <input type="text" class="form-control mb-3" id="outputText" placeholder="Output" value="Output goes here">
    </div>
    <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="makeDelphi()">Ponder (briefly)</button>

    <div class="delphi">
        <div class="delphi-inner">
            <div class="delphi-message">Delphi says:</div>
            <div class="delphi-desc">
                <span class="delphi-span">
