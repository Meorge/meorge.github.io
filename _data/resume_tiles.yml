      <p>
        As a graduate of the International Baccalaurate Diploma Programme,
        I know how important good time management is.</br>
        That's why I always use lists and schedules to make sure I'm using
        my time the best way I can.

      <p>
        The ability to work well with others is one of the most important
        qualities a good worker can have.</br>
        The IB Diploma Programme taught me how to be a part of a team, and
        projects like <a href="sneaksters.html">Sneaksters</a> and
        <a href="zenith2020.html">Zenith 2020</a> have given me lots of practice.
